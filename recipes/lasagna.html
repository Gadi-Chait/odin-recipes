    <h2>THE WILD MUSHROOM GREEN VEGAN LASAGNA WITH 2 MULTI-PURPOSE SAUCES</h2>
    <p>A comfort food fave, with a twist. This green vegan lasagna is so yum, and perfect for these fall feels. Make a big batch, or a few dishes worth to freeze for a dinner freak out kinda day! That’s my jam. I don’t like spending hours in the kitchen prepping one day for the full week… instead, I make the most of when I actually am in the kitchen. If I’m chopping an onion, I chop 3, and put them in the fridge for a different recipe… If I’m making lasagna, I make A LOT of it so leftovers can flow like an awesome mountain bike trail that just keeps on giving. </p>
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 box lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>1 sweet or yellow onion, diced</li>
      <li>2 cups chopped wild mushrooms</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic,minced</li>
      <li>2 tbsp italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1 jar tomato pasta sauce</li>
      <h4>Cashew Cheese Sauce</h4>
      <li>1.5 cups soaked cashews</li>
      <li>1/4 cup nutritional yeast</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsweetened plant milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Pre-heat oven to 350F</li>
      <li>Sauté the onions, mushrooms, Italian seasoning, and garlic with a bit of water if it’s sticking. </li>
      <li>Cook noodles according to directions (some lasagna noodles don’t need to be pre-boiled). Bring a pot of water to a boil, add noodles and salt, let cook for the time told, strain and run cold water over them.</li>
      <li>Make the Green Sauce: Add all the green sauce ingredients except for the lentils to your blender and whiz it up until smoooooooth. (you can use this sauce as a dip, pasta sauce or a spread for your wraps)… Then stir in the lentils.</li>
      <li>Layer it up! Start with tomato sauce on the bottom of your baking dish (around 13 x 9-inches), then a layer of noodles, then green sauce, cheese sauce, onion + wild mushroom saute, tomato sauce, and repeat. Finish it off with noodles, then cheese sauce on top!</li>
      <li>Cover with tin foil and bake for 40 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 10 minutes</li>
      <li>Let sit for 10, and serve with fresh basil</li>
    </ol>
